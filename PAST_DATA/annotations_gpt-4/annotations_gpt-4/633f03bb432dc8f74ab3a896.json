      "message": "So stealing a loaf of bread is a difficult thing. First, where are you stealing the loaf of bread from? Is it from a small business that\u2019s owned by immigrants or is it from a multinational corporation? That can carry emotional weight. My second thought is what happens when you steal it and why? Did you steal because you were hungry, and just enough to satiate that hunger? I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m opposed to it. Because there are layers. We live in a society where people can\u2019t feed themselves and their children. I can\u2019t blame people for not dying and stealing something to feed themselves. You look at stores and they throw out tons of food, including bread, everyday. That\u2019s a problem. We are a society that has too much in many ways. And if people can\u2019t eat, let them eat. That\u2019s the right thing to do. It shouldn\u2019t even be stealing. If stores are going to throw it out they should give it to people. Give not steal. ",
