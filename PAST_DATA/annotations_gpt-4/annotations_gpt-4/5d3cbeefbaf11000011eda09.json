      "message": "It is moral to steal bread when you cannot afford to feed yourself. However the way that you steal it and who you steal it from can change how moral the act is. The most moral act of stealing bread would be dumpster diving. I would say dumpster diving is moral even if you could afford the bread. Because food waste is a serious issue and perfectly edible food gets thrown out by large corporations every day. As well as many other food items. Next level would be stealing bread from inside the store. As long as this is a big box or large corporate store this is still fairly moral. However the likelyhood of getting caught is higher. And getting caught could put an emotional strain on an employee who feels obligated to say something for fear of losing their job. The last level and the least moral would be to steal bread from a random old lady. If you steal bread from a random old lady, you better be starving and mute. Random old ladies would probably give you the bread so you should just ask before robbing them.",
