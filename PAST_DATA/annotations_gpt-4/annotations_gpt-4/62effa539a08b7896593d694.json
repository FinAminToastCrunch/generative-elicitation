      "message": "First of all, I really enjoy articles revolving around politics. I try to stay up to date on what's going on in the United States, as well as the US's relations to other countries. Outside of politics, I am interested in all things space related. I really enjoy hearing about new planets being discovered, as well as new advances in NASA technology. Third, I am a huge nature lover. Whenever a new species is discovered, or anything related to wildlife is researched, I like to know about it. This involves both land and sea creatures. Speaking of which, I am fascinated by creatures that live at the bottom of the ocean. I love to learn about what mysterious creatures leave deep under water. Next, I am a huge video game fan. My favorite system is the Xbox, but I enjoy all game systems. I like hearing about new video game developments as well as new system prospects. My favorite video game, by far, is Mortal Kombat. Finally, I am a big sports fan. I love professional soccer, MLB, and college basketball. The World Cup and March Madness are by far my favorite sporting events!\r\n\r\n",
