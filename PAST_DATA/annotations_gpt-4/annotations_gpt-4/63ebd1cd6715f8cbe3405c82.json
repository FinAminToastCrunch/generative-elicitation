The act of stealing in this specific scenario can be seen as a means of preventing harm and promoting the well-being of another individual. The intention behind the action is compassionate and driven by the desire to alleviate suffering. However, it is important to consider the context and evaluate whether there truly are no other viable alternatives before resorting to stealing.",

However, when the intention is to feed a multitude of starving birds in the park and a legal alternative exists, even if it requires spending money that one would rather save, the legal alternative is considered more ethical.
