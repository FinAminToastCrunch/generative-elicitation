What if that loaf of bread is going to be the only food that they (and their family) get all week? What if there isn't any soup kitchens or places that give out free food nearby? They have to be able to get food somehow! Besides, there is too much food waste in the world. Do you know how often food gets thrown out? This food could be going to soup kitchens and homeless shelters. A lot of times stores will ruin the food they throw out, just to stop homeless (or needy) people from having the food. It is a cruel world out there, I don't think letting poor people steal a loaf of bread is really going to break the bank. A lot of businesses out there are so rich-they'll never even miss the money from one (or several) loaves of bread.",
