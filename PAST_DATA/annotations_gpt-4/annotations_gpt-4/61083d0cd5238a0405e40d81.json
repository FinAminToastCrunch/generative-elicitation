      "message": "I think that there is a lot to consider when questioning the morality of stealing a loaf of bread. I think the first thing that must be considered is what the circumstances are of the individual doing the stealing. If the person is stealing it out of a need--to feed themselves or others out of economic crisis, I think if the circumstances are right, this act could be considered morally permissible. If the person is stealing it for the thrill of stealing, or for economic gain--I do not believe that the act is morally permissible ever. The middle ground to me would be if the person stealing the bread in an act of protest. If the circumstances were right--i.e. boycotting a morally corrupt corporation, I could see how it might be considered morally just. That brings me to the circumstances. If the party is stealing from a small business or individual that would be directly harmed by the act, I think stealing would automatically be not moral. If the act is being done at a super large corporation, I can see how it might be considered moral. Morality and ethics are extremely subjective based on myriad factors. I think the entire specific circumstance must be considered.",
