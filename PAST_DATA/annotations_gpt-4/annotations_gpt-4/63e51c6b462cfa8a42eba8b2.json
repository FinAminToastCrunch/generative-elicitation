      "message": "I think inherently there isn't a true time to ever steal a loaf of bread, but I do understand that some people may justify it and call it moral by saying that they are stealing out of a necessity, but see a necessity can always be obtained in other ways. There is not only one way to steal the bread, that is actually the extreme hard way to go about things that's disguised as the easy way out. What do I mean by that? Well, if you steal the bread, it solves the problem instantly, yes, but then you broke the law and now you may have solved the hunger problem of necessity, but now you are faced with the new problem that you broke the law, so you just converted the problem into another problem. Another way you could of gone about it while still remaining morally sound is to take up a job that you regularly wouldn't take, even if it is something that you never would do, as that is only killing your pride, not your morality. Pride is a bad thing so killing your pride can be construed as good. I would rather shovel excrement for 8 hours in the hot sun and earn a measly $2 than to steal. This way, I solve the problem, don't break the law, and stay morally good. Is it harder? Of course it is, but the lasting effects are instant afterwards. You're fed, you can sleep at night, and you haven't jeopardized your freedom. Going to prison for a piece of bread is not worth it, even if you are hungry. I've worked jobs back in my youth that paid less than $3 an hour out in the hot sun only to pay for the cheapest ramen and vegetables. I understand that life can be extremely tough, but don't make it even tougher by stealing. If you're struggling now, wait until the law catches a hold of you, then you wish you were just hungry and working shoveling excrement rather than confined in a small metal and concrete box with nothing to do but think about your actions. It is NEVER okay to steal. ",
