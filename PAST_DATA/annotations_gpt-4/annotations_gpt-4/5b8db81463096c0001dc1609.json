    "preamble": "We are testing a system for understanding people's fuzzy intuitions and preferences.\nIn this activity, we're going to be looking at different strings of text and you'll be deciding if they look like they could be an email address or not. For example, most people would agree that \"username@domain.com\" looks like an email address, while \"n12z5lFEN4\" does not. However, the rules for what can be an email address can be very unusual, so what we're really interested in is your intuition on what an email address could look like. \n<b>Tip:</b> in an email such as username@cs.stanford.edu, \"username\" is called the local-part of the email, while \"cs.stanford.edu\" is the domain. Furthermore, \"cs\" is a subdomain, and \"edu\" is a top-level domain.",
    "task_description": "your intuition of what is or is not possible for an email address",
    "final": "In the final part of the study, you will give feedback on a test set of email addresses, which will enable us to see how well a chatbot reading your responses has learned your email preferences.",
    "evaluation": "Please indicate whether you think the following strings look like reasonably well-formatted email addresses or not: \"yes\" if they do, \"no\" if they don't."

      "message": "To me an email address usually has a \"personalised\" part at the beginning (before the \"@\"), which indicates the purpose or owner of the address - for example \"Help@xyz.com\" tells me that it is from a customer support department, team, or someone handling queries, wheras \"noreply@xyz.com\" tells me that it is an automated, outgoing mailbox, and that there isn't a human at the other end who can respond to you. If it has a name like \"TonySmith@xyz.com\", then it is going to be a (likely professional) mailbox for a single individual with that name. \r\n\r\nSome people might chose to have a fun, personal email address, i.e. \"GroovyChick69@xyz.com\", which tells me this isn't a professional account, and is probably only for personal use. \r\n\r\nSpam mailboxes usually don't seem to match the content of the email sent, and are usually along the lines of \"Vadim_Chang828163918@my.tesco.account.com\" - I would be wary of this because of the unusual name combination, along with a long number chain, and a long domain name that doesn't match genuine emails from the company usually send.
