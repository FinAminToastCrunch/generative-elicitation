      "message": "I enjoy reading a multitude of online articles. I like simple, easy to follow articles that contain photographs. I tend to enjoy reading about travel, feel good stories or interesting political topics as well. Sometimes I also enjoy a good celebrity gossip article. Articles that I tend to find quite boring are typically scientific articles as well as articles that are wordy or contain too many numbers/figures such as articles on economics. Sometimes those can be difficult to wrap my head around. Usually I read articles to relax or to indulge my curiosity and to learn and expand knowledge on a topic which I am already interested in. I like articles that are on the shorter side. Lengthy articles lose my interest and attention. Even though I like pictures in an article, if they do not have photos, it is not the end of the world either as long as they are written very descriptively so that I can really imagine the topic at hand. I also like articles about different cultures. It is always interesting to hear how other people live and what life is like in other places throughout the world. I find it fascinating. ",
