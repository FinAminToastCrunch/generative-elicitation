      "message": "In my opinion nobody should steal if a legal way exists to get food. They should seek those avenues first, and use the government, whether locally or nationally to find food before resorting to theft. Many programs exist that offer food for the poor, which include shelters and churches locally, and nationally SNAP comes to mind. Those should be something anyone who needs food should explore first who realizes they'll need food soon.\r\n\r\nThose looking for food immediately do have options, and while many may not be appetizing to most, they do exist. Dumpster diving, begging, and taking jobs off the street to work labor can provide money to find ways to nourish oneself.\r\n\r\nIf those all fail, and you've exhausted all avenues, then if it's between starving and stealing then it is likely permissible.
