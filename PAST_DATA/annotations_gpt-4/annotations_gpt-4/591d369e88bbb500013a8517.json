      "message": "In reading articles online I look for things that will interest me. The first thing that comes to mind is health related information. I like to read about different food and drink that may be beneficial or harmful to me. That's something I like to keep on top of and always catches my eye. Also I like to read articles about mens grooming. Even though I look like I probably don't spend much time taking care of myself, I do care about my skin and I am constantly on the lookout for articles about different products or different things I can do to improve my skin. Other articles I like to read are recommendations for things to watch on streaming services. It's always entertaining to read those and I like to keep up with what the newest releases are. When it comes to news, I tend to read articles that are sort of true crime based. The sorts of articles that have to do with murder or abductions. It seems kind of creepy when I type that out, but I do enjoy reading those sorts of articles. Sometimes I will read articles about current politics. I might read something that talks about Trump or Biden. But for the most part, for politics, I just read the headlines. I sometimes read articles on business and technology matters. I like to keep up with some of the business related news and technology like new phones.",
