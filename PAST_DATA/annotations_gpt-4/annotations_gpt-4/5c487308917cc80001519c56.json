Ethically, it's just a loaf of bread, let it go, but if the corporation wants to look good, they can find other means with which to better the person's situation; offer of a job, offer more food, cash assistance, etc. But, when it comes to a family-owned business, they're stereotypically more likely to look the other way, and offer other assistance to the person caught stealing than a large corporation.
