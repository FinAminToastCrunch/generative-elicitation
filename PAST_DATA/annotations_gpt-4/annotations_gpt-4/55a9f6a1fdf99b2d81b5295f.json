      "message": "I enjoy factual articles on science. I am in science so I even appreciate technical details. Pieces that are technical in nature are fine to me. I also appreciate art. I think art criticism online is lacking so I look for any article on artwork at all. Anything multidisciplinary is also interesting to me. Therefore many article I read are academic in nature due to the appreciation of multiple aspects of reality in academic articles. The more technical and dry the better. Therefore philosophy is also one of my interests. There are many philosophical articles online so to me finding philosophical articles is separating the wheat from the chaff. However my interest in philosophy is very keen so I appreciate many aspects of philosophy. Political articles are the gimme since everyone reads those. The balanced international perspective is always what I am looking for. Overall this should paint the picture of what I enjoy reading online which is outside views on subjects others consider dry. It is genuinely possible to increase your knowledge base through mass media on occasion with the right kind of selection I feel. One must just use caution.",
