There are times in which one may have to forgo meals, or go to obtain items to have a meal but have a card decline. They may not be able to make their car payments, pay their mortgage or rent, or even have enough for a cup of ramen noodles. In this case, I would dismiss someone stealing a loaf of bread, as they may be struggling. It is not an expensive food item and not something that can be resold well outside of a store - therefore I am making the assumption that they are desperately in need of a meal.",
