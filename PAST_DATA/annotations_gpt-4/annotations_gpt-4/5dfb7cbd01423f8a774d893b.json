    "preamble": "We are testing a system for understanding people's fuzzy intuitions and preferences.\nIn this activity, we're going to be looking at different strings of text and you'll be deciding if they look like they could be an email address or not. For example, most people would agree that \"username@domain.com\" looks like an email address, while \"n12z5lFEN4\" does not. However, the rules for what can be an email address can be very unusual, so what we're really interested in is your intuition on what an email address could look like. \n<b>Important:</b> We are not asking you to determine the rules for a *good* email address, or a *real (non-spam)* email address. We are simply asking about your intuition as to why certain strings look like email addresses and certain strings do not. \n<b>Tip:</b> in an email such as username@cs.stanford.edu, \"username\" is called the local-part of the email, while \"cs.stanford.edu\" is the domain. Furthermore, \"cs\" is a subdomain, and \"edu\" is a top-level domain.",

    "final": "In the final part of the study, you will give feedback on a test set of email addresses, which will enable us to see how well a chatbot reading your responses has learned your email preferences.",
    "evaluation": "Please indicate whether you think the following strings look like reasonably well-formatted email addresses or not: \"yes\" if they do, \"no\" if they don't."
